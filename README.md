RSA Factoring Challenge
Tasks
0. Factorize all the things!
#advanced
Factorize as many numbers as possible into a product of two smaller numbers.
•	Usage: factors <file>
o	where <file> is a file containing natural numbers to factor.
o	One number per line
o	You can assume that all lines will be valid natural numbers greater than 1
o	You can assume that there will be no empy line, and no space before and after the valid number
o	The file will always end with a new line
•	Output format: n=p*q
o	one factorization per line
o	p and q don’t have to be prime numbers
o	See example
•	You can work on the numbers of the file in the order of your choice
•	Your program should run without any dependency: You will not be able to install anything on the machine we will run your program on
•	Time limit: Your program will be killed after 5 seconds if it hasn’t finish
•	Push all your scripts, source code, etc… to your repository
o	we will only run your executable factors
1. RSA Factoring Challenge
#advanced
RSA Laboratories states that: for each RSA number n, there exist prime numbers p and q such that
n = p × q. The problem is to find these two primes, given only n.
This task is the same as task 0, except:
•	p and q are always prime numbers
•	There is only one number in the files
